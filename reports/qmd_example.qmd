# Aim
This project explores the historical population of horses in Canada 
between 1906 and 1972 for each province.

# Data
Horse population data were sourced from the 
[Government of Canada's Open Data website](http://open.canada.ca/en/open-data) 
[@horses1; @horses2].

# Methods
The Python programming language [@Python] and the following 
Python packages were used to perform the analysis: pandas [@pandas], 
altair [@altair], click [@click], as well as Quarto [@Allaire_Quarto_2022].  
*Note: this report is adapted from Timbers (2020) [@ttimbers-horses].*  

# Results

@fig-horse-pops shows the horse populations for all provinces in Canada.

```{python}
import pandas as pd

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv("../results/horses_sd.csv")
```

![Horse populations for all provinces in Canada from 1906 - 1972](../results/horse_pops_plot.png){#fig-horse-pops width=80% fig-pos="H"}

As seen in @fig-horse-pops, Ontario, Saskatchewan, and Alberta have had the highest horse populations in Canada.  

## Standard Deviation of Horse Populations

We present the standard deviations in **@tbl-horses-sd** below.

:::{#tbl-horses-sd tbl-cap="Standard Deviation of Horse Populations"}

| Province          | Std      |
|------------------|----------|
| Saskatchewan     | 377265.6 |
| Ontario         | 266435.3 |
| Alberta         | 266063.2 |
| Manitoba        | 122403.9 |
| Quebec          | 111411.1 |
| New Brunswick   | 22019.5  |
| Nova Scotia     | 19879.3  |
| British Columbia | 14945.7  |
| P.E.I.          | 11355.7  |

:::

As seen in **@tbl-horses-sd**, the province with the highest spread of horse populations is **Saskatchewan**.

![Horse populations for the province with the largest standard deviation](../results/horse_pops_plot_largest_sd.png){#fig-largest-sd width=65% fig-pos="H"}

In **@fig-largest-sd**, we zoom in and analyze the province of **Saskatchewan**, which had the highest variation in horse populations over time.
